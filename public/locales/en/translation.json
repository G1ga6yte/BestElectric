This is because the battery, which is large and heavy, is usually integrated into the floor, providing additional body rigidity and better occupant protection in the event of an accident. Crash tests on the Euro NCAP website confirm that all electric vehicles tested received the maximum 5 stars safety rating. Some people worry about the possibility of spontaneous combustion of lithium-ion batteries in electric cars, citing cases of similar incidents with laptops and mobile phones. However, automakers take a wide range of measures to prevent such situations, including the use of heavy-duty steel casings for batteries, separating them into individual cells (to prevent the spread of fire), and multiple fuses, switches and cooling systems. In fact, research shows that electric cars, which do not use flammable fuels, are much less likely to catch fire than conventional cars.",
